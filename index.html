            At BnB Music School, we believe that the joy of music is for
            everyone. <br />Our mission is to empower students of
            all ages and skill levels to play the instrument of their choice. We
            achieve this through personalized lessons tailored to each student's
            goals. Our unique approach combines the best aspects of the Suzuki
            and Kodály methods, ensuring a well-rounded musical education that
            balances learning by ear, memorization, with music literacy.
            <br />We are committed to delivering the best for every
            client through our qualified instructors, comprehensive lesson
            planning, and careful progress tracking.
